# Touch-Bright An accessible digital spinoff of the classic Lite•Brite™.

## Overview

Touch-Bright started out as a small weekend project for my kids. Now I am working to complete it as a proper web app/game for kids. In doing so, my goal is to make Touch-Bright as accessible and inclusive as possible.

I know this is a graphic creation app, but with the natural grid structure of the Lite•Brite™ I feel that making this accessible to the visually impaired is completely possible.


### Goals
